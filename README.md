# ToDoList
This is a dynamic To-Do list where users can add, mark tasks complete and remove tasks.
<br>
I have created html file containing input field and add button to add tasks and also created task box to keep tasks.
<br>
In css file I have given styling to the html elements to make it attractive.
<br>
In javascript file I kept main logic where i have created each task dynamically based on the user input task.
<br>
I added event listeners to add button(to add tasks) and to remove button(to remove tasks).
<br>
I have used toggle class to denote completion and incompletion of tasks.
<br>
And I have used local storage to show tasks even after page reload.
<br>
I have used media queries to make it responsive.
<br>
It updates instantly without page reload.
